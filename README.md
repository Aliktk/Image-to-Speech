## Overview

The **Image-to-Speech Application** transforms images into spoken stories through an AI-driven pipeline. Using advanced models from Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Gradio, this application takes an image as input, generates a caption, creates a short narrative, and then converts the story to speech. The application provides a user-friendly interface to bridge the gap between image processing, natural language generation, and text-to-speech synthesis.
